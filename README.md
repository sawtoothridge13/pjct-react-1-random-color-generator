## Random Color Generator

A react web application that will show a random color when a button is clicked.

# TODO

- [x] Create a Figma design of the web app including:

  - [x] Header that says `Random Color Generator`
  - [x] Box to contain generator
  - [x] Container for background color
  - [x] Container for hex code
  - [x] Hex code text matching background color
  - [x] Button with `Generate` as text

  Figma design mockup: see `figma-design.png`

- [] Create header that says `Random Color Generator`

  - [] Black Text
  - [] White Background

- [] Create button that says `Generate`

- [] Create container where the hex code and button will appear
  - [] Hex code and container color must both be the same when `Generate` button is pushed

Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- [ ] A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- [ ] Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` (the background color and the hex code must match)

Our suggestions for breaking down the task into TODOs:

- If you need a reminder of how we did this last week, watch the video showing breaking down tasks
- Read the [Breaking Down Tasks Into TODOs](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/tasks/#breaking-down-tasks-into-todos) page on the Learning Platform
- This time, you will need to think about design in the browser: Design the web app with a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or by sketching the design out on paper
- Come up with a detailed list of features you'll need for the application above
- For each of the features, write which dependencies, functions and React component(s) you'll need for them, if any
- Describe how each component will interact with the other components
- Identify any unknowns

## Stretch Goals

- Ask for a hue
- Ask for a lightness
- Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
- Use a CSS-in-JS library for all styling (eg. Emotion or Styled Components)
- Ask for a size for the color box and generate a box of that size
- Make a "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color (eg. like [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935696/93082456-42d27100-f691-11ea-872a-7cb7c0df6b9a.gif))

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Preflight runs through without errors in your project
  - [ ] Link in your GitHub repo's About section: Netlify deployed website
- [ ] Project has been [imported into CodeSandbox](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#codesandbox) and a comment has been added below with the sandbox URL
- [ ] [Drone bot](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#upleveled-drone) has been tagged and responded with a passing message
- [ ] Correct GitHub commit message format (see [Writing Commit Messages](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#writing-commit-messages))
- [ ]

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
